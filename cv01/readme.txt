First steps with ImageJ
=======================

- Create a folder named "PB130" under "ImageJ/plugins" and copy the content of the "01.zip" archive there
- Via "File -> Open...", open a few sample images from "PB130/images" (e.g., leaf.jpg, rotated_leaf.jpg, or tree_rings.tif)
- What is the size and bit-depth of these images?
- Via "Image -> Color -> Split Channels", extract individual channels from an RGB image
- Via "Image -> Type", convert an RGB image into a grayscale one
- Try other functions under the "Image" menu (e.g., zooming in/out, scaling, flipping) 


Compilation of the first simple ImageJ plugin
=============================================

- Compile the "Complete_AddLineGrid.java" file via "Plugins -> Compile and Run"
- Refresh the content of menus via "Help -> Refresh Menus"
- Run the plugin via "Plugins -> PB130 -> Complete_AddLineGrid" over an opened 8-bit grayscale image (e.g., "Tree Rings")
- Open the java file in your favourite text editor and study the plugin structure and implementation


Implementation of ImageJ plugins
================================

- Open the My*.java files in your favorite text editor and complete the "run()" methods in the following order: 
	- My_FlipX (flip a given image horizontally)
	- My_FlipY (flip a given image vertically)
	- My_FlipXY (flip a given image horizontally as well as vertically in a single image pass)


Validation of completed ImageJ plugins
======================================

- Validate all the three plugins by compiling and running the "UnitTests_01" plugin located under "PB130"


Submission of completed ImageJ plugins
======================================

- The list of files to be submitted and the homework vault link are given in the interactive syllabus
- Before submission, carefully check that your code neither contains clumsy constructions nor typical errors as listed in the interactive syllabus
